# Description

This module generates a .webp copy of an image as it is loaded by Drupal 9. The copy is saved in the same directory as the original, and the output image's source is replaced to serve the smaller, faster, file.

## To Dos:

- Integrate with media module to generate copies on upload
- Create twig templates with `<picture>` and fallback image
